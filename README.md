# [60-30-10% Rule](https://youtu.be/UWwNIMHFdW4):

pallete:
60% is the neutral color or creamy color. Can be a dark color
30% is the primary color
10% is the call to action color ("click me, do something with me" - like play buttons)

Reverse:
60% is the bright color
30% is a lighter hue
10% on the actionables, still
(colors instead of neutrals)

Dark:
60% really dark colors (black)
30% lighter colors (like a dark orange on black)
10% for accents/actionables (bright orange)

Gradients work well on the 30%.
